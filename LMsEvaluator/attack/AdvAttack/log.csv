"I [[rented]] I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is [[centered]] around a young [[Swedish]] [[drama]] student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. [[In]] particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the [[Vietnam]] War and race issues in the United States. [[In]] between [[asking]] politicians and ordinary denizens of [[Stockholm]] about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her [[drama]] teacher, classmates, and [[married]] men.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />What [[kills]] me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a [[plot]].","I [[tenancy]] I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967.

"""[[I]] Am Curious: Yellow"" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the [[claim]] that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a [[clitoris]] in sight. And those pretentious [[indie]] [[movies]] like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of [[pink]] visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should [[take]] into account one [[unavoidably]] obvious anatomical difference between men and [[women]]: there are no genitals on display when [[actresses]] appears [[nude]], and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an [[admittedly]] [[depressing]] ability to [[come]] to terms culturally with the insides of women's [[bodies]].","""[[me]] Am Curious: Yellow"" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile.
